  **Bitlocker** is the default full volume encryption that comes with Microsoft Windows. Over the years there has been development since it was released in 2007 and the main reason we recommend it is because of it's [use of TPM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/how-windows-uses-the-tpm). [Elcomsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElcomSoft) a forensics company has written about it: [Understanding BitLocker TPM Protection](https://blog.elcomsoft.com/2021/01/understanding-bitlocker-tpm-protection/).
