type: Recommendation

  **Brave** is built upon the Chromium browser, featuring a built in adblocker and some [privacy features](https://brave.com/privacy-features/) enabled by default.

  We only recommend Brave as a desktop browser. There are better [alternatives on mobile platforms](/browsers/#mobile-only-recommendations).

  ##### **Shields**
  Change the adblocker to agressive mode (≡ Settings → Shields → Trackers & ads blocking).

  Change the fingerprinting blocker to strict mode (≡ Settings → Shields → Fingerprint blocking). You can always downgrade it if you need to. We **do not** believe the [fingerprint protection](https://brave.com/privacy-updates/4-fingerprinting-defenses-2.0/) Brave offers is as strong as that of a [well-configured Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/firefox-protection-against-fingerprinting).

  ##### **Social media blocking**
  Disable social media components (≡ Settings → Social media blocking -> Uncheck all options).

  ##### **Privacy and Security**
  There are a few options in here you may want to change.

  * Set the [WebRTC IP Handling Policy](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017989132-How-do-I-change-my-Privacy-Settings-#webrtc) to *Disable Non-Proxied UDP* (≡ Settings → Privacy and Security → WebRTC IP handling policy).
  * Enable https everywhere (≡ Settings → Privacy and Security → Security → Always use secure connections)

  ##### **Sanitizing on close**
  Select every option in clear browsing data on exit except *Site and Shields settings* (≡ Settings → Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data → On exit).

  ##### **Extensions**
  Disable all extensions which you do not use (≡ Settings → Extensions). You should not use the Tor tab in Brave. Brave is **not** as resistant to fingerprinting as the Tor Browser and will make you stand out.

  ##### **IPFS**
  InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a decentralized peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed filesystem. Unless you use it, consider disabling this (≡ Settings → IPFS → Method to resolve IPFS resources).

  ##### **Background apps**
  Disable background apps (≡ Settings → System → Continue running apps when Brave is closed).
